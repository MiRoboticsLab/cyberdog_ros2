## Branch management

All our repositories are divided into two branches for development, which are `devel` and `main`.

- The `devel` branch is used for development.
- The `main` branch is used to store the stable version. If and only if a new version needs to be released, freeze the `devel` branch a from the `devel` branch, and perform the following steps:

  - Modify `CHANGELOG`, sort out new features and pre-fixed bugs in the pre-release, and determine  the release version.
  - Pass by CI, including construction and testing. 
  - The test engineer will fully test the new functions and issues proposed in the step 1. If there is a problem, the relevant developers are required to submit the repair code to the `devel` branch timely according to the method of fixing the problem.
  - If tests are passed, the code and binary package of the project will be packaged and encapsulated.
  - `Release` in the interface.
